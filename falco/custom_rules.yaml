  condition: container.id != host

- macro: shell_binaries
  condition: proc.name in (bash, sh, zsh, ash)

- macro: sensitive_files
  condition: fd.name in (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/sudoers, /etc/ssh/sshd_config)

- macro: trusted_network_ports
  condition: fd.sport in (22, 80, 443) or fd.rport in (22, 80, 443)

# --- Custom Rules ---

# 1. Detect unexpected shell in a container
- rule: Unexpected shell in container
  desc: Alert if a shell is spawned inside a container
  condition: evt.type = execve and container and shell_binaries
  output: "Falco Alert: Unexpected shell spawned inside container (container=%container.name proc=%proc.name user=%user.name)"
  priority: WARNING

# 2. Detect write to sensitive system files
- rule: Write to sensitive file
  desc: Detect any write to sensitive system files
  condition: evt.type in (open, openat, creat) and evt.is_open_write=true and sensitive_files
  output: "Falco Alert: Sensitive file write attempt (user=%user.name file=%fd.name proc=%proc.name)"
  priority: CRITICAL

# 3. Detect unexpected network connection
- rule: Unexpected outbound connection
  desc: Detect processes connecting to non-standard ports
  condition: evt.type = connect and fd.type = ipv4 and not trusted_network_ports
  output: "Falco Alert: Unexpected outbound connection (proc=%proc.name user=%user.name dst=%fd.rip:%fd.rport)"
  priority: WARNING

# 4. Detect execution of unexpected binaries on host
- list: trusted_binaries
  items: [/usr/bin/amazon-ssm-agent, /usr/bin/nginx, /usr/bin/java, /usr/bin/docker, /usr/bin/containerd]

- rule: Unexpected binary execution on host
  desc: Detect execution of non-trusted binaries on the ECS host
  condition: evt.type=execve and not container and not proc.exe in (trusted_binaries)
  output: "Falco Alert: Unexpected binary execution on host (proc=%proc.exe user=%user.name)"
  priority: WARNING

# 5. Detect privilege escalation
- rule: Privilege escalation via setuid
  desc: Detect attempts to escalate privileges with setuid
  condition: evt.type = setuid and evt.dir=> and evt.arg.uid=0 and user.uid != 0
  output: "Falco Alert: Privilege escalation attempt (proc=%proc.name user=%user.name target_uid=%evt.arg.uid)"
  priority: CRITICAL
